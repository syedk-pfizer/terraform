# Hands-on Terraform

This repository provides hands-on exercises and examples for working with Terraform, an infrastructure as code (IaC) tool by HashiCorp.

























## Removing Heavy Provider Files/Folders

To remove heavy provider files/folders from your system, follow these steps:

1. Make the `remove_terraform_folders.sh` script executable by running the following command:
   ```
   chmod +x remove_terraform_folders.sh
   ```

2. Execute the script by running the following command:
   ```
   ./remove_terraform_folders.sh
   ```

   This script will remove the heavy provider files/folders from your system, freeing up disk space.

Note: Make sure you understand the implications of removing these files/folders and ensure that they are no longer needed before executing the script.
